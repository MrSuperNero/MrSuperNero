## Hi all, and welcome to King Khan's Domain
I'm joking. My name is Mahdeen Khan, but I go by Neo. I am a student at Yale University majoring in Computing and the Arts. This is a new major which is a cross between Computer Science and Visual Art.

I am currently working on my Frontend Skills by learning React and designing my own web-based projects for fun!

ðŸŽ¥ Fun Fact: I was indeed named after the main character from the Matrix series.
