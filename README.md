# Hi all, and welcome to King Khan's Domain
I'm joking. My name is Mahdeen Khan, but I go by Neo. I am a student at Yale University majoring in Computing and the Arts. This is a new major which is a cross between Computer Science and Visual Art.

I am currently learning React and designing my own web-based projects for fun! I am working towards being a Frontend Developer, and hopefully soon, a Full Stack Developer.

ðŸ’» Languages and Frameworks I Know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, C

ðŸŽ¥ Fun Fact: I was indeed named after the main character from the Matrix series.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email is mahdeen.s.khan@yale.edu.
